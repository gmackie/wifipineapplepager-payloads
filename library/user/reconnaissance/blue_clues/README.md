# Blue Clues

**Blue Clues** is a Bluetooth reconnaissance tool for the WiFi Pineapple Pager. 

**Update (v2): Passive Scanning Mode**
This tool has been reworked to focus on stealth and autonomy. Instead of manual "scan-and-review" cycles, Blue Clues now acts as a **Passive Scanner**. You configure the duration and feedback behavior once, and the device runs silently in the background, only alerting you when a target is captured.

### Features
* **Passive/Silent Operation:** The screen remains dark during operation to maintain stealth.
* **Custom Feedback:** Configure alerts (LED, Vibe, Both, or Silent) to trigger *only* when a new device is found.
* **Auto-Logging:** All findings are appended to a local file in real-time.
* **Timestamped Entries:** Every captured device is logged with the exact time of discovery.

**2. Feedback Configuration**
First, decide how the device should alert you when a Bluetooth device is detected.
* **Silent:** Logs data but gives no physical cue.
* **LED/Vibe:** Visual or haptic confirmation of a capture.
